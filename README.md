The RSA Encryption System demonstrates the integration of various cryptographic 
concepts, including the Linear Congruential Generator, Miller-Rabin Primality Test, and 
modular arithmetic operations. The generateKeys method stands out as a mean 
component, the generation and use of public and private keys, is essential for secure 
communication. Challenges encountered during implementation underscore the 
complexity of cryptographic systems, emphasizing the need for a lot of testing and 
collaboration. 
Overall, the RSA Encryption System showcases the beauty of discrete mathematics in 
securing digital communication.
